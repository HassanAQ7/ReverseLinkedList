## Purpose
To solve the DSA problem of reversing a LinkedList, the solution involves traversing the LL
and modifying the nodes and their pointer to reverse it. Traversal involved so solution is O(n)







## Where did AI Agent help

- Verifying whether the test cases I thought of are valid or redundant
- Coming up with certain test cases that I may have missed out on/making the ones I thought of more rigorous
- test method signatures
- imported both junit4 and junit5 by accident, it was able to identify that and fixed it
